forkb0t command language
========================

extended commandset
-------------------
These commands are available for use anytime before the stream has been
segmented and delinked from the metadata structure. This would be anywhere
between the swallow() and transmute() functions.
 Key advantages over simple set:
  1. The matadata for the stream can be accessed
  2. Commands can manipulate the execution of multiple lines

/core <function> [arguments...]
 Execute a function in forkb0t's core.

/set <variable> <value>
 Sets the content of a variable in the metadata structure linked to this stream.



simple commandset
-----------------
After the stream is segmented and metadata is destroyed, a limited set of
functionality is available in the individual segments. These commands are
available anywhere between the swallow() and poop() functions.
 This subset is restricted such that:
  1. The network is predefined and cannot be changed
  2. Each item may contain ONE command

/ctcp < nick | channel > <text>
 Send a CTCP PRIVMSG to the target. Only valid for IRC.

/join <channel> 
 Join the specified channel on TARGET.

/kick [<channel>] <nick> [reason]
 Remove a user from a channel on TARGET, with an optional message. Channel is required in simple set, if left out in extended set, it defaults to TARGET.CHANNEL

/msg < nick | channel > <text>
 Sends text to specified user or channel on the network in TARGET.

/nctcp < nick | channel > <text>
 Send a CTCP reply (via NOTICE) to the target. Only valid for IRC.

/notice < nick | channel > <text>
 Send text as an informational message to the target. Such messages should will never prompt a reply. For IRC this is a NOTICE.

/part <channel> [message]
 Leave the specified channel on TARGET, and display the optional message.



final commandset
----------------
These commands are unique in that they:
 1. May be standalone OR nested in the extended set (before transmute())
 2. MUST be nested in the simple set (after transmute())
The transmute() function will convert any standalone commands into appropriate
nested ones before it destroys the metadata structure and segments the stream.

/me <text>
 Modify text to appear if forkb0t was speaking in third person. For example, "/me eats a taco" would be seen as "forkb0t eats a taco". Nestable in /msg only. For IRC this produces a CTCP ACTION.

/say <text>
 Send the following line of text without parsing further. Nestable in /msg only.
